# gitKatas
This repository is all about the git katas
basic-commits - Very basic creation of commits.
basic-staging - Interacting with the stage (index).
basic-branching - The first stride into branching.
ff-merge - A tour around the most trivial of merges.
3-way-merge - A basic merge, involving multiple diverged branches.
merge-conflict - A basic merge between diverging branches with incompatible (but simple) changesets.
merge-mergesort - A merge conflict with actual code.
rebase-branch - Using rebase as an alternative to merging.
basic-revert - Use revert to revert a change
reset - Reset is a powerful and slightly dangerous command if you do not know what you are doing. Go through the three modes of resetting here.
basic-cleaning - Cleaning the workspace.
amend - Amending previous commits.
reorder-the-history - We might have created our commits in a suboptimal order, practice to fix that scenario here.
squashing - A lot of small commits is good when you are working locally, but for sharing your code, it might be more beneficial to deliver your code changes in large sets. Go here to experiment with that. Write a good commit
advanced-rebase-interactive - Practice using the interactive rebase commands.
basic-stashing - The first stride into stashing.
ignore - The basics of using the .gitignore file. And using git rm.
submodules - Submodules are loathed by many. Run through this exercise to see what the ruckus is all about.
git-tag - Tags are convenient for keeping track of commits that bump a version number. In this exercise, you will list, add and delete tags.
